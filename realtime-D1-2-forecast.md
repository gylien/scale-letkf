## Online nesting forecast for domain 1 and 2
### Overview

* Domain setting  

| | Domain 1 | Domain 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Target area | Japan | part of Japan |
| Map projection | Lambert conformal conic | Mercator \*|
| dx | 18 km | 6 km |
| Model top | 28.8 km | 28.8 km |
| levels | 36 | 47 |
| dt | 40 sec | 20 sec |
| Number of processes | 192 | 256 |
| Number of subdomain in X | 12 | 16 |
| Number of subdomain in Y | 16 | 16 |

\* **This map projection configuration is only a temporal treatment necessary for offline-nesting with current version (SCALE 5.3). It is not confirmed that Mercator projection is safe to use for D2.**  

* Boundary data

NCEP GFS analysis and forecast data is used for the boundary condition for domain 1.
